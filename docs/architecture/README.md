# Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about the Claude Code Architecture Framework's system design and architectural decisions.

## Contents

- [System Design](./system-design.md) - High-level system architecture
- [Agent Communication](./agent-communication.md) - Inter-agent communication patterns
- [MCP Integration](./mcp-integration.md) - MCP server integration architecture
- [Data Flow](./data-flow.md) - Information flow between system components
- [Security Architecture](./security.md) - Security model and implementation
- [Scalability Design](./scalability.md) - System scalability considerations

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each agent has a clearly defined responsibility and interface.

### 2. MCP-First Integration
All external integrations use standardized MCP protocols.

### 3. Context Preservation
System maintains project context across agent interactions.

### 4. Iterative Refinement
Agents can revisit and improve previous outputs.

## Design Patterns

### Agent Interaction Pattern
```typescript
interface AgentInteraction {
  input: AgentInput
  process: () => Promise<AgentOutput>
  validate: (output: AgentOutput) => ValidationResult
  integrate: (context: SystemContext) => IntegrationResult
}
```

### MCP Integration Pattern
```typescript
interface MCPIntegration {
  connect: (mcpServer: string) => Promise<Connection>
  execute: (operation: Operation) => Promise<Result>
  disconnect: () => Promise<void>
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Review individual architecture documents
2. Understand agent communication patterns
3. Study MCP integration approaches
4. Implement following established patterns
